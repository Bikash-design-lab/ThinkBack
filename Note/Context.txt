You are a helpful assistant. Think of you are a senior software engineer having 10+ years of experience and you are here to help me with my project. 

My project is about AI Educational Helpdesk Platform (SSE Streaming). 

I want to build this project using the following tech stack:
    Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
    Backend: Python, FastAPI, SSE streaming
    Database: MongoDB
    AI: Gemini API (streaming)
    Hosting: Vercel(Backend + Frontend + Database on mongodb atlas)

The application will have the following features:
    1. User can create tickets
    2. User can view tickets
    3. User can chat with AI
    4. User can ask AI about a ticket
    5. AI responses should be streamed in real-time

It's be in simple and precise detailes added right, strictally follow the context. No direct code changes implemented without my permission. 
You need to generate a plan first and ask me for permission to implement it(Idea behind is I need to amually reviw and approve your suggested changes)

Application must be robustness, fast and scalable, secure and user-friendly. 
The approach to ensure the UI does not break across different devices (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops) is called **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**. Given your tech stack, I propose using **Tailwind CSS** with a **Mobile-First** strategy.

#### Proposed Strategy:
1.  **Mobile-First Approach**: Define base styles for small screens and use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to adjust the layout for larger devices.
2.  **Flexible Layouts**: Utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid utilities to create fluid containers that adapt to screen width automatically.
3.  **Responsive Navigation**: Implement a collapsible sidebar or hamburger menu for mobile users to maximize screen real estate.
4.  **Adaptive Chat UI**: Ensure the AI streaming interface scales correctly, maintaining readability and usability on both touch devices and desktops.

#### Implementation Steps:
1.  Configure `tailwind.config.ts` with standard breakpoints.
2.  Create a responsive `Layout` component to wrap the application features (Tickets, Chat).
3.  Apply responsive utility classes to the Ticket list and Chat modules to handle overflow and scaling.

Possible to use component based for frontend and backend? So that it will optimised for mobile, tablet and desktop. Also later we can enhance and easy to change anything if required.

### Proposed Logging Strategy Plan:
1.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: Create a utility that checks for the `VERCEL` environment variable. If absent (local), enable `DEBUG` level logging; if present (cloud), set level to `CRITICAL` to suppress standard logs.
2.  **Frontend (React/Vite)**: Implement a logging wrapper using `import.meta.env.DEV` to conditionally execute `console` methods only during local development.

#### Implementation:

```typescript
// --- Frontend: src/utils/logger.ts ---
const isLocal = import.meta.env.DEV;

export const logger = {
  info: (message: string, ...args: any[]) => {
    if (isLocal) console.log(`[INFO]: ${message}`, ...args);
  },
  error: (message: string, ...args: any[]) => {
    if (isLocal) console.error(`[ERROR]: ${message}`, ...args);
  },
  warn: (message: string, ...args: any[]) => {
    if (isLocal) console.warn(`[WARN]: ${message}`, ...args);
  }
};

// --- Backend: app/utils/logging_config.py ---
import os
import logging

def setup_logging():
    # Vercel sets the 'VERCEL' environment variable automatically
    is_cloud = os.getenv("VERCEL") is not None
    
    if is_cloud:
        # Suppress logs in production/cloud
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)
    else:
        # Enable detailed logs locally
        logging.basicConfig(
            level=logging.DEBUG,
            format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
        )

# usage in main.py
# setup_logging()
# logger = logging.getLogger("api")
```
